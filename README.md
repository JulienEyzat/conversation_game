A very simple game with backtracking IAs.

The rules of the game:
- Each turn, a player choose a quote which can be positive, negative or neutral.
- On a normal turn, a player can only say a positive or negative quote.
- If three quotes of the same type are said in a row, the player has to play a neutral one.
- If the next player say a quote from the same type of the three before, he loses the game.

For humans, this game have an interest with time limit and quotes from human memory, but, here, I just use it to test some simple backtracking algorithms.
